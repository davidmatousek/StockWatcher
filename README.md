I am building an iOS stock watching application for the purpose of learning the following:

1) How to use GitHub actions to build, test, and deploy to iOS app store
2) How to use GitHub projects to manage the building of the applicaiton
3) Connect to an existing free stock API and display date on a screen using SwiftUI
4) Build out a wiget to take advantage of a live view on the iOS screen
5) Have a small version of the app that can be previewed.
6) Use and demo new iOS14 features
